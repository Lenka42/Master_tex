\chapter{From 0D to 2D}
In solid state physics physicists usually describe various materials and phenomenas in terms of wave vector (remember eq. \ref{eq:wave_fun}). But introduction of wave vector only in case of perfect crystal (without impurities and atoms displacements) and when periodic boundary conditions are enforced. This situation is quit far from reality. So I decided to check, if it is legitimate approximation of real-world crystals.
