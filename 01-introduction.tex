Tight-binding (TB) method is an approach to the calculation of energy band structure of various materials, where electrons are tightly bound to the atom to which they belongs. So that an approximate set of wave functions based upon superposition of wave functions for isolated atoms located at atomic sites is used.

TB method was developed by F. Bloch \cite{bloch} in 1928.  Bloch considered only the $s$ atomic orbital. In 1934 H. Jones, N. F. Mott and H. W. B. Skinner \cite{mott} considered wave functions constructed by solving a secular problem between $s$, $p_x$, $p_y$ and $p_z$ Bloch functions.
